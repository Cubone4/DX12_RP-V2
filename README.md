I've recently been studying DX12 documentation, Nvidia GPU architecture, and WinAPI documentation, and wanted a project where I could combine my findings.

While this project is far from perfect and can be significantly improved, I plan on continuing working on this to better my understanding of DX12.

Currently, the move direction is tied to a global axis and not relative look direction. This can feel extremely awkward, but I will fix this soon.

**Controls**

- Hold right click to look around
- While holding right click, use WASD to move around
- Q to move down, E to move up
